<h2>Steps walk-through:Here's where the adventure begins</h2>

<p align="center">

Open AWS Account: Log in <br />
(1)Navigate to Services. <br />
(2) Select EC2: Click on EC2 to enter the realm where Kali Linux will come to life!: <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h3>Let's tailor your Kali Linux machine to your specifications:</h3>

(1) Name Your Machine: Give your hacking lab a distinct identity by assigning it a name.<br/>
(2) Search for Kali Linux: Type "kali linux" in the search box and press "ENTER". <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h3>Let's pinpoint Kali Linux in the AWS Marketplace</h3>
(1) Explore AWS Marketplace AMIs: Click on "AWS Marketplace AMIs"  <br/>
(2) Locate and Select Kali Linux <br/>

<br />
<br />


<h3> By selecting Kali we will get back automatically to the configuration page, so lets resume our configuration baking </h3>
(1)Adjust Instance Type: Opt for the T2 Micro instance type image -it's within the free tier, aligning perfectly with your budget-friendly hacking lab. 
<br />
(2)Click on "Create Key Pairs".<br/>

<br />
<br />
<h3> Name Your Key Pair </h3>
(1) Name Your Key Pair: Choose a distinctive name for your key pair - in this example, it's named "Lord Sauron." <br />
(2) Click on "Create Key Pair." The key pair file will automatically download to your PC. <br />

<br />
<br />

Remember, guard this key pair like the One Ring! Store it securely as it's your ticket to connect with your Kali machine via SSH. Losing it could be as perilous as losing the One Ring to Mordor.

<br />
<br />

<h3>With the key pair secured, let's kick off the building process: </h3>
Back to Configuration: After creating the key pair, you'll be automatically redirected to the configuration page. <br />
Launch Instance: Click on "Launch Instance" to initiate the construction of your Kali Linux machine. <br />
Now, sit back, relax, and give it a moment. Your hacking lab is in the making! üöÄüíª

<br />
<br />

<h3>Your Kali Linux instance is now ready for action: </h3>
(1) Browse from EC2 Service: Navigate to the EC2 service to find your freshly baked Kali Linux instance. <br />
(2) Ready to Use: Your instance is now fully operational and ready for your ethical hacking experiments! <br />
A friendly reminder: To keep your hacking lab budget-friendly, don't forget to stop the instance when not in use. Happy ethical hacking! üåêüíª<br/>
